# monopoly online

Project is multiplayer "boardgame" based on fameous "Monopoly game". There is lobby for players complete and now I'm working on game mechanics.
Player can create rooms for hosting games and join rooms created by other players. Once there is minimum 2 players in game, players can start a match. 
Game is made in turn-system. Players move around the board by tossing dice. Rest of game mechanics is now in development. Actions in game are synced by websockets managed by Channels.


Technologies:

Python/Django ( + Channels 2 for handling WebSockets)
Html/CSS
Javascript
Redis
